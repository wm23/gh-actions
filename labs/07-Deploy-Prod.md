# Deploy on push to `master` or `main`

In this session, we are going to be deploying the application to various production style environments. This will take the built **Docker** Container and deploy it to one or more of the various environments.

### Exercise: Deploy Docker images

> **Note:** Before you add the code below, you will need to setup **Github Secrets** To help hold credentials in environm.

- **DockerHub**
  - `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` - Username to authenticate to DockerHub
  - `DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD` - Password to authenticate to DockerHub
  - `DOCKER_ORG`         - Your Docker organization

#### Deploy to DockerHub

1. Create a new branch called `Deploy`
1. Add the following file to your repository: `.github/workflows/deploy-prod-docker.yml`


```yaml
# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: Docker Production

# Controls when the action will run.
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - 'master'
      - 'main'

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  docker-prod-release:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # You could use the following lines to help make sure only X people start the workflow
    # if: github.actor == 'admiralawkbar' || github.actor == 'jwiebalk'

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - name: Checkout source code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
